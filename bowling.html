    <h2>Bowling is a very slay sport.</h2>
    <img id = "bowlingBase" src="https://d21gd0ap5v1ndt.cloudfront.net/web04/img.php?src=/images/2020-21/Bowling/King-Hannah-WBowl20-21-Midway01.jpg&site=msc&crop">
    <p>Tennis is a team sport, with typically 4 people on each team. Bowling is played in lanes in bowling alleies. Players roll a bowling ball down the lane and try to score points by knocking down bowling pins.</p>
    <p>Points are scored according to how many of the 10 bowling pins they knocked down in two rolls.</p>
    There are many different plays in bowling, consisting of:
    <ul>
        <li>    Strike: This occurs when the player knocks down all 10 pins in their first roll. This is awarded 10 points plus double points for their next two rolls.</li>
        <li>    Spare: This occurs when the player knocks down 10 pins in 2 rolls. This is also awarded 10 points plus double points on their next first roll</li>
        <li>    Normal scoring: This occurs when the player knocks down any number of pins during their two rolls. This is awarded the same number of points as pins they knocked down</li>
        <li>    Gutterball: This occurs when the ball is rolled into the gutters at the edge of the lane resulting in 0 points.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common stratagies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Where to stand: Bowlers must stand behind the line at the edge of each lane and can be  penalized for overstepping.</li>
        <li>How to hold the ball: Bowlers should hold the ball putting their thumb in the bottom hole and two other fingers in the top holes.</li>
        <li>How to roll the ball: Bowlers should step forward while moving their ball hand backward, then move their hand forward and release the ball.</li>
