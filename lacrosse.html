    <p>Lacrosse is a team sport with 10-12 players on the field at once depending on the gender of the game. Points are scored by tossing the lacrosse ball into the opponents net. Players all have a lacrosse stick, a long pole with a net at the end, used for interecting with the ball as it stays in the players net until it is handed off. </p>
    <p>There are many different positions a player can be. Including: <p>
    <ul>
        <li>    Goalie: This player protects the net with their body and large net. They wear lot of protection like helmets and padding and are the only players allowed inside the circle around the net.</li>
        <li>    Defenders: These players protect the goal from opponents by stopping them before they can take a shot on goal. They block their opponents attackers and pass the ball to midfielders.</li>
        <li>    Attackers: Thses players try to score the ball into their opponents net. They get the ball from the midfielders and shoot the ball past defenders.</li>
        <li>    Midfielder: Midfielders start the game with a toss up and bring the ball back and forth between defenders and attackers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>General field positions are shown below</p>

    <h3>Good things to know</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The game is started with a toss-up, this is when two players from opposing teams place their nets back to back with a ball in the middle and move upward. This sets the ball into play</li>
        <li>A ball goes out of play when it crosses the perimiter of the field, whether it be in the air or on the ground.</li>
        <li>Stick checking is allowed at different levels to varying degrees, stick checking is when one player hits their lacrosse stick to another players stick and/or body</li>
        <li>Body checking and stick checking are more encouraged in lacrosse than most other sports, this means that the players have to wear protection include mouthguards, and eye protection in women's lacrosse and full body protection in men's lacrosse.</li>
    </ul>
