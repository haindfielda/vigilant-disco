    <h2>Roller Derby is a very slay sport.</h2>
    <img id = "rDerbyBase" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53ce8a4ae4b02facb941faed/1619047325984-CXU6VMCT9JK1XD311IL8/blog-name-change-david-dyte.png?format=1000w">
    <p>Roller derby is a team, contact sport, with typically 5 people on the track for each team. Roller derby is played on tracks, traditionally this track was slanted (or banked) however, few teams still play on this type of track, most play on flat tracks. Games consist of jams, or mini games, that last up to two minutes, with an unlimited number of jams in each game providing they do not exceed the 30 minute halfs. Teams score points when their jammer passes the opposing blockers.</p>
    <p>There are two main positions for skaters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>    Jammer: the jammer is idenitfied at the beginning of every jam by the star on their helmet. The jammer trys to get their hips past as many of the opposing blockers as they can to score points for their team.</li>
        <li>    Blockers: the blockers try to simutaneously prevent the opposing jammer from getting past and assist their jammer in getting past the opposing blockers.  </li>
    </ul>

        <li>How to hold the ball: Bowlers should hold the ball putting their thumb in the bottom hole and two other fingers in the top holes.</li>
        <li>How to roll the ball: Bowlers should step forward while moving their ball hand backward, then move their hand forward and release the ball.</li>
