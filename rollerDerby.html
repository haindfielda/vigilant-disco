    <img id = "rDerbyBase" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53ce8a4ae4b02facb941faed/1619047325984-CXU6VMCT9JK1XD311IL8/blog-name-change-david-dyte.png?format=1000w">
    <p>Roller derby is a team, contact sport, with typically 5 people on the track for each team all being on roller skates. Roller derby is played on tracks, traditionally this track was slanted (or banked) however, few teams still play on this type of track, most play on flat tracks. Games consist of jams, or mini games, that last up to two minutes, with an unlimited number of jams in each game providing they do not exceed the 30 minute halves. Teams score points when their jammer passes the opposing blockers. Players also can never move backward, only forward.</p>
    <p>There are 3 positions for skaters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>    Jammer: the jammer is idenitfied at the beginning of every jam by the star on their helmet. The jammer trys to get their hips past as many of the opposing blockers as they can to score points for their team.</li>
        <li>    Blockers: the blockers try to simutaneously prevent the opposing jammer from getting past and assist their jammer in getting past the opposing blockers.  </li>
        <li>    Pivot: The pivot is a blocker most of the time during play, however, the jammer can pass their star cap to the pivot during the game, making the pivot the jammer and the previous jammer a blocker.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Track set up is pictured below</p>

        <li>A player may only block using their torso, hips, arms above the elbow, and legs above mid thigh</li>
        <li>Players may not make contact while the jammers are not trying to get through both teams' blockers</li>
        <li>Hip checking, body checking, and body blocking are all allowed</li>
        <li>Because of the contact involved in roller derby, players are required to wear helmets, mouthguards, knee pads, and elbow pads. </li>
