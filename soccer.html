    <p>Soccer is a team sport where two teams compete for the most points scored during a 90 minute game. </p>
    <p>Points are scored when the ball enters the goal, placed at either end of the field.</p>
    <P>11 players are on the field for each team, typically consisting of:</P>
    <ul>
        <li>    1 goal keeper -or goalie- who blocks balls using their body to prevent the opposing team from scoring points</li>
        <li>    4 defenders who help the goal keeper by preventing players from kicking the ball towards the goal</li>
        <li>    3 forwards/strickers who try to kick the ball down the field and into the opponents goal</li>
        <li>    3 midfielders who help bring the ball back and forth between defenders and forwards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Formation is shown below</p>
