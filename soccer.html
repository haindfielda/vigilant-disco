    <p>Soccer is a team sport where two teams compete for the most points scored during a 90 minute game.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Points are scored when players kick the ball into the opponents net</li>
        <li>11 players are on the field at any given time, typically consisting of:</li>
        <li>         1 goal keeper -or goalie- who blocks balls using their body to prevent the opposing team from scoring points</li>
        <li>         4 defenders who help the goal keeper by preventing players from kicking the ball towards the goal</li>
        <li>         3 forwards who try to kick the ball down the field and into the opponents goal</li>
        <li>         3 midfielders who help bring the ball back and forth between defenders and forwards</li>
