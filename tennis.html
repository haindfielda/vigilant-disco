    <p>Tennis is an individual and partner sport (1 vs. 1 or 2 vs. 2) played on a court with a net placed in the middle. The two teams volley the tennis ball back and forth using their rackets. They do this to score points.</p>
    <p>"A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. 
    The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "love", "15", "30", and "40", respectively."</p>
    <P>There are many different stances in tennis, consisting of:</P>
    <ul>
        <li>    Open stance: Player stands with their feet apart facing parralel to the net, also the most common</li>
        <li>    Closed stance: Player's feet are placed with one closer and one farther from the net, also the most rare</li>
        <li>    Semi-open stance: A combination of closed and open stances, player's feet are diaconally placed facing the net</li>
        <li>    Neutral stance: Players feet are perpendicular to the net and in line with eachother, typically taught first</li>
