    <p>Tennis is an individual and partner sport (1 vs. 1 or 2 vs. 2) played on a court with a net placed in the middle. The two teams volley the tennis ball back and forth using their rackets. They do this to score points.</p>
    <p>"A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. 
    The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "love", "15", "30", and "40", respectively."</p>
