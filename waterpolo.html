    <p>Water polo is a contact, team sport, consisting of two teams of 7 players. The players all play in a pool so that they cannot touch the ground with their lil' piggies with the risk of possible drowning. The teams score points by throwing the ball into their opponents goal.</p>
    <p>There are a few positions in the pool</p>
    <ul>
        <li>    Goalkeeper: This player tries to block the oppoens scoring attemps on their goal by using their arms and torso to block the ball</li>
        <li>    Field players: These players play both offense and efense as they try to prevent the opposing team from scoring and try to score on their opponents goal</li>
        <li>    Rubber ducky manager: This player is arguably the most important in the pool, they keep track of and manage all of the rubber ducks, bath crayons, and other bath toys.</li>
    </ul>
